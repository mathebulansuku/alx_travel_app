# alxtravelapp

## üìå Objective

The **alxtravelapp** project is a real-world Django-based backend application created as part of a learning milestone to simulate industry-grade travel listing platforms. This phase focuses on initializing a robust, modular, and scalable Django project that leverages modern tools and best practices in backend development.

Through this project, learners will:

- Master advanced project initialization and modular settings management.
- Integrate and configure a MySQL database for reliable data persistence.
- Use Swagger (via `drf-yasg`) to provide automated API documentation.
- Set up CORS headers for secure API consumption.
- Prepare for future asynchronous task handling with Celery and RabbitMQ.
- Follow industry best practices for project structure, version control, and collaborative development.

## üì¶ Project Scope

This milestone involves the following key deliverables:

### ‚úÖ Project Initialization
- Create a Django project named `alxtravelapp`.
- Add an app named `listings` for core travel listing functionalities.

### üîß Dependency Management
Install and configure the following packages:
- `django`: Core web framework.
- `djangorestframework`: For building RESTful APIs.
- `django-cors-headers`: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
- `drf-yasg`: For Swagger-based API documentation.
- `celery` and `rabbitmq`: For future asynchronous task handling.
- `django-environ`: For managing environment variables securely.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration and Tools Integration
- Use `.env` files to manage settings securely.
- Set up MySQL as the default database engine.
- Enable and configure CORS for frontend/backend integration.
- Integrate Swagger for interactive API documentation available at `/swagger/`.

### üöÄ Version Control and Collaboration
- Initialize a Git repository.
- Structure the codebase for team collaboration and maintainability.
- Push the project to a GitHub repository named `alxtravelapp`.
